title: "Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection as an Acceleration Mechanism in Earth’s Magnetotail"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'The majority of ions that undergo energization by the turbulent fields cross the magnetic null plane multiple times. By preferentially energizing these particles, the turbulence creates a separate population of ions that mostly exits in the dawn direction of the magnetotail and forms a high-energy power-law tail in the ion flux-energy distribution.'
