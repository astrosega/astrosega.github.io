Summary
-----------
In this course, engineering and science majors will learn about the basic laws of motion in classical mechanics. They will learn how and why objects in our day-to-day move (or stay put) the way they do and will know how to predict projectile and rotational motion. They will also learn about the nature of scientific laws and the stadistical nature of scienctific measurements.

There's a lot more information about this course -- including details about the textbook, who should/shouldn't take this class, how your grade is calculated, and a checklist for success -- in the [syllabus](astrosega.github.io/files/2048C.pdf).

Course Material
--------------
The primary "required readings" are in the OpenStax book [University Physics 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1). Here are some additional resourses:

* An excellent, more abridged e-book for this course is available though the FSU Library [Fundamental of Physics I](https://fsu-flvc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?institution=01FALSC_FSU&vid=01FALSC_FSU:Home&isbn=9780300243772&genre=book&eisbn=9780300249583&title=Fundamentals%20of%20Physics%20I&sid=jstor:jstor). Give it a try if the OpenStax book treatment of a topic does not click with you. R. Shankar writes in a very particular voice that can help some students.
* This book is based in R. Shankar [Open Lectures](https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200) (Yale University), which are available online. They where and still are a helpful resourse for me.
