Summary
-----------
In this course, science and non-science majors will learn about our solar system, the birth and death of stars (including our own Sun), the nature of black holes and galaxies, and the structure and evolution of the entire universe. We will discuss what astronomers know today about each of these things, how we know it, and what we still don't yet know.

There's a lot more information about this course -- including details about the textbook, who should/shouldn't take this class, how your grade is calculated, and a checklist for success -- in the [syllabus](../files/ASR1002.pdf).

Course Material
--------------
The primary "required readings" are in the OpenStax book [Astronomy-2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy-2e). We will also be using [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/), given the difficulty to see the nigth sky in Panama City. Likewise, for a stand-in Planetarium we will be using [The World Wide Telescope](https://www.worldwidetelescope.org/)

[Here](../files/finalAST.pdf) you will find a detailed step-by-step description of the Final Project assigment. Read carefully.

Here are some additional resources:

* [This page](https://stevencranmer.bitbucket.io/ASTR_1200_2019/math_links.html) contains links to additional resources (including YouTube videos) for extra help on the MATH topics of this course.
* [Here](https://radioambulante.org/en/translation/goodbye-pluto-translation) is the English transcript of the Radio Ambulante episode Goodbye Pluto
